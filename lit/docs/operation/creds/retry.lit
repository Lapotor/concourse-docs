\title{Retrying failed fetches}{creds-retry-logic}

\use-plugin{concourse-docs}

When a request to the credential manager fails due to an intermittent error
(e.g. a timeout or \code{connection refused}), Concourse will automatically try
the request again up to 5 times before giving up. After all attempts fail, the
error will be surfaced in the UI for the resource check or build step that
initiated the request.

The retry logic can be configured by specifying the following env on the
\reference{web-node}:

\codeblock{bash}{{{
CONCOURSE_SECRET_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=5   # how many times to try
CONCOURSE_SECRET_RETRY_INTERVAL=10s # how long to wait between attempts
}}}

Note for Vault credential manager: as Vault API client already does retry which
has covered the retry conditions of this general secret fetching retry, if a
deployment uses Vault credential manager, \code{CONCOURSE_SECRET_RETRY_ATTEMPTS}
can be set to 0 (or a small value, like 1 or 2) in order to avoid duplicate retries.
